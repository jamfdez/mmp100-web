        In this animation, I wanted to capture a calm and peaceful feeling. 
        The clouds move slowly across the sky while the trees sway softly, 
        almost like they are breathing. The relaxing music ties everything 
        together, turning a simple scene into a quiet moment of serenity.

      <h3 class="animation-subtitle">Why This Animation Matters</h3>
      <p class="animation-text">
        This animation matters because it shows how simple motion and sound 
        can change how we feel. There are no fast cuts or heavy effects. 
        Instead, the slow clouds, gentle trees, and soft music work together 
        to create a space that feels quiet and safe. It is a reminder that 
        even small, simple scenes can carry a strong emotion.

    <!-- Right box: What I learned -->
    <div class="animation-box">
      <h3 class="animation-subtitle">What I Learned</h3>
      <p class="animation-text">
        Working on this project taught me how timing, smooth movement, and 
        audio all have to support the same feeling. I learned that if the 
        clouds move too fast or the music is too loud, the calm emotion breaks. 
        By adjusting the speed, easing, and sound levels, I was able to make 
        the whole piece feel more peaceful and controlled.

      This project also showed me that planning the emotion first makes it 
      easier to choose the right motion, sound, and pacing for the final animation.
