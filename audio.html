    <p class="section-text" style="text-align:center; max-width:700px; margin:auto;">
      This 8-minute audio project was created for my MMP 100 class. 
      I focused on combining clear sound, emotion, and rhythm to tell a story through audio. 
      The design below shows both my idea and what I learned while making it.

      <h3 class="audio-subtitle">Project Idea</h3>
      <p class="audio-text">
        My idea for this audio project was to build an atmosphere that helps people focus or relax. 
        I used ambient sounds and calm music layers to create a flow that feels peaceful but keeps the listener engaged. 
        I wanted each sound to have a meaning and connect to the emotion I was going for.

      <h3 class="audio-subtitle">What I Learned</h3>
      <p class="audio-text">
        While making this project, I learned how sound balance changes the whole mood. 
        Adjusting volume levels and fades helped me shape how each part felt. 
        It showed me that great audio is not just what you hear—it's how it makes you feel and how every small detail connects.
