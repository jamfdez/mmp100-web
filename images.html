      This page shows the three parts of my Photoshop project: an old school version,
      an AI-assisted version, and a fully AI-generated version. Each one has a description of the tools I used and my thought process making them.

       This image was made using only traditional Photoshop tools. I combined three photos using masking and the move tool to show two different sides of life—struggle and happiness. The hardest part was finding free images and arranging them to send a deeper message about real-world issues like homelessness.

       This version mixes my own ideas with AI tools. I started with a fall background and turned it into a night scene with stars, then added a photo of myself looking at the sky to reflect how I was feeling at the time. I used tools like masking, Select Sky, Generative Fill, and the Brush tool to blend everything together.

       This image was created fully with AI. I used Adobe Firefly and tested multiple prompts to create a futuristic version of New York City. The main challenge was learning how to use the prompts correctly and choosing a strong idea. This image shows how I imagine the future shaped by technology.
